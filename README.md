# 🛡️ Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Snort

## ✅ TASK 4 - Cyber Security Internship

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using **Snort**, a powerful open-source intrusion detection engine.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- 🔍 Detect suspicious or malicious network traffic
- 🧰 Configure Snort with custom rules
- ⚠️ Generate alerts on potential intrusions
- 🔄 Respond to detected threats
- 📊 Optionally visualize detection statistics

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- 🐧 **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 (or Kali Linux)
- 📡 **NIDS Tool**: [Snort](https://www.snort.org/)
- 📑 **Rulebase**: Local and community rules
- 📁 **Log Location**: `/var/log/snort/`
- 📊 *(Optional)*: Visualization using ELK Stack, Grafana, or manual logs

🔁 Response Mechanism
You can respond by:

Sending alerts via email/slack (optional script)

Logging suspicious IPs

Triggering firewall rules (iptables)

📊 Optional: Visualize Alerts
For better visibility, integrate with:

ElasticSearch + Kibana (ELK Stack)

Grafana + Loki

Manual log parsing + Excel/CSV

✅ Results
Configured NIDS using Snort

Successfully created detection rules

Captured and logged malicious test traffic

Demonstrated simulated attacks using ping and nmap

(Optional) Visualized logs on a dashboard
